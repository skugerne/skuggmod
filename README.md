# skuggMod
A [Zero-K](http://zero-k.info/) mod for experiments.

Zero-K is a very fine RTS, according to me.  Also, its easy to mod.  This little repo is dedicated to experimenting with Zero-K via a local mod.

This mod is a "mutator" as described at [the Zero-K wiki](http://zero-k.info/mediawiki/Mod_Creation).  Basically you put the directory (with a name ending in .ssd) inside the games folder, in Zero-K.  Files in the official game are replaced by those provided in the mutator.  A bit of game config needs to be tweaked to make the mod available.
